introtext: "The Zero-G Division's 2019 mission goal is to develop a scientific payload for launch on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket. With the rocket’s altitude reaching nearly 100 kilometers, our experiment will travel beyond the Karman Line, the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. Our project will spend around 4 minutes in this microgravity environment, providing an exciting opportunity to conduct a scientific experiment. Our team consists of four subteams: BME, Mech-E, EE and CS. Together, we are developing a flight-ready biomedical research payload."
