abstracttext: "We are competing in NASA's Space Robotics Challenge – Phase 2."

introtext: "NASA is hosting the second phase of its Space Robotics Challenge (SRC). While Phase 1 focused on NASA’s humanoid R5 in a virtual Martian environment, the second phase (independent of Phase 1) seeks to advance the capabilities of autonomous lunar surface robots. To successfully complete the qualification round (= place among the top 25), teams will have to develop software so that the provided robots can complete a set of tasks autonomously and efficiently on the simulated lunar surface. The final competition round will require to develop software for teams of lunar robots in simulation.
;
To say it with NASA’s words:
“The focus of SRC Phase 2 is on the ability of virtual robotic systems to perform a long-term fully-autonomous ISRU mission for the Moon. This challenge will require competitors to develop software that allows a team of virtual robots (i.e., virtual robotic team) to operate fully autonomously for a specified length of time. The Competition Rounds will be carried out in a robotic simulation format, using Open Robotics Gazebo and Robot Operating System (ROS) platforms.”

This CSI mission begins in January 2020, and will end in August 2020. NASA will provide more detailed information on the robot models in mid January 2020 (thus we will start working in January), and the qualification round opens in March 2020.

This CSI mission is application only. The team will consist of selected PhD, master and advanced undergraduate students. We are currently working on organizing this mission as a research course so that team members can sign up for course credit. If you are interested in this mission, please apply here: XXX
