abstracttext: "Our mission is to place the first satellite designed by Columbia undergraduates into low Earth orbit."

introtext: "NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative gives undergraduate students the opportunity to design and launch a small satellite into low Earth orbit. A cubesat is a standard satellite design that is 10x10x11.35 cm3. If NASA accepts our design, we will be funded to build our cubesat and have it launched into orbit!"
