We have submitted our preliminary design to NASA. The final design is an
assembly of around 9 parts: the cone, shaft, 5 plates, piston, and blocking bar.
The cone piece that is the first part to make direct contact with the surface is
threaded for ease of penetration. The shaft serves as the housing for the piston
and the plates attached by individual hinges. A person pushing on the piston
activates the plate assembly and they slide out of their holes and grip the
m_barnes. Our design underwent many changes during the brainstorming procedure.
Our inspirations were river anchors, screwpile drills, and the fractal design
used on the Rosetta comet.
