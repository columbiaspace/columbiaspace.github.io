With the start of the new semester, we're welcoming new members to the mission. 
Here's how you can get involved, from least to most participation.

1. Check this website often. We try to post news here quite often.
2. Join the mailing list for Columbia Space, so you can keep up with general 
body meetings and different events. There's a sign-up form on the bottom of the 
front page of this website.
3. Join our Slack channel. This is where almost 99% of our communcation takes 
place. It moves fast too, so check back every day. Once you join our mailing 
list, you'll get an invite to our Slack group. You can join the "balloons" 
channel from there.
4. Join our Google Drive Folder. All of our documents, notes and resources get 
posted on Drive and Slack. Both of these are crucial if you want to participate 
actively.
5. Attend mission-specific meetings. We'll be choosing the days/times for these 
at the General Body meeting.
6. Join a sub-project group. Whether it's payload preparation or physics 
calculations, you'll be contributing directly to the success of this project.

Thanks everyone for the interest, we're trying to launch by early April. With 
your support, we can make this a reality.
