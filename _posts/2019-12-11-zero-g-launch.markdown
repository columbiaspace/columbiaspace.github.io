Our payload launched today on Blue Origin's "New Shepard" rocket. This was the first payload Columbia University (and CSI) have sent into outer space! Big thank you to all the team members who have worked hard on this mission during the last 1.5 years, and to the Mechanical Engineering Department for funding it.
