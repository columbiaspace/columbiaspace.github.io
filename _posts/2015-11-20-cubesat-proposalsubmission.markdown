Good news! We've submitted our 60+ page proposal to NASA today for the Student 
Flight Research Opportunity (SFRO). Many thanks to all the team members who've 
contributed to the creation of this proposal! Our cubesat experiments will test 
the tensile properties of glass, and the viability of certain radiation 
shielding on commercial electronics. We'll keep you updated on our results.
