We're making some steady progress.

We've managed to acquire helium thanks to Jordi! Thank you Jordi!

We finished maintenance on our old electronic equipment. We will begin work on 
the 10DOF sensor from Marco (thanks!) and the ozone sensor whenever it comes in.

This Saturday (so, tomorrow) we will be working on the GoPro mount as well as 
the 10DOF sensor.

We've also updated CCSC on our details and such, so we should be getting some 
of our equipment soon!

We're on the final stretch, hopefully we can get almost everything ready to go 
by the end of this month. No, we WILL get everything ready to go by the end of 
this month.
