Since the start of our mission in Summer 2018, we've been working hard on the development of our payload throughout the past academic year. Our four subteams - BME, Mech-E, EE and CS - have developed the entire experiment design together from scratch. In addition, we have secured funding for the development of our payload and for the launch fees for a spot on New Shepard. We also have successfully secured a spot on the P9 flight of Blue Origin's rocket and are looking forward to the launch!
