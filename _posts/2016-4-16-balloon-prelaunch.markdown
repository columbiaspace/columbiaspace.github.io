We're launching our balloon tomorrow! We'll be launching at 10AM from Prattsville, NY.

You can track the balloon [here](http://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FKF7YAF&timerange=3600&tail=3600).

A quick run-down of the mission:

* We're launching a 1600g balloon with multiple payloads:
	* An APRS Radio GPS tracker
	* A SPOT Satellite GPS tracker
	* A 10DOF (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, temperature, pressure) sensor logger and GPS logger package
	* A Ozone sensor logger
	* A GoPro with a Roaree (Columbia University's mascot) plushie as the subject
	* A Radar Reflector
* Goals:
	* Get weather balloon experience
	* Detect the ozone layer
	* See if we can get anything interesting from the 10DOF sensors
	* Set a precedence for more ambitious and significant flights in the future
	* Get some sweet, sweet footage from 100,000 ft

We're looking forward to a great launch!
