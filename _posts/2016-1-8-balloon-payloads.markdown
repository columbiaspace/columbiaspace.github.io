With the completion of our GoPro crowdfunding campaign, we have now acquired all of our payloads!

- ARPS tracker (Byonics)
- GPS logger (Arduino)
- SPOT tracker, sponsored by [W2AEE Columbia University Amateur Radio Club](http://www.w2aee.columbia.edu)
- GoPro camera, sponsored by [crowdfunding](https://www.gofundme.com/csigopro)
- Geiger Counter, sponsored by [The ERGO Project](http://www.ergotelescope.org/about-ergo/ergo-pixels/)

Here's a quick look at what we have left to do:

- Set up payloads to make sure they work
- Determine launch logistics
- Send some more emails and stuff
- Purchase more materials through our CCSC grant
