Spread across countries and continents, we are continuing the development of our payload during this summer. The BME subteam is finalizing the experiment setup and will be conducting tests in a laboratory on campus soon. The CS subteam is working on the on-board software, while the Mech-E and the EE subteams are both working on the manufacturing of the payload locker. We are also working on the payload documentation required by NanoRacks/Blue Origin. Space missions know no summer breaks! ;)
