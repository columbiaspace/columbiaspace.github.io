This Saturday was our fourth(?) time participating in CU Splash, a day-long event for high school students to learn topics outside of the classroom. We taught a course called "Intro to Space Exploration," where we introduced basic orbital mechanics, propellants, space history, and challenges in space.

For many of our students, this was their first exposure to space science and aerospace engineering.

In addition to the science, we discussed commercial space companies, international space industries and modern innovation like suit ports and inflatable space modules.

We held two sections and each had 40+ students. We had lots of fun inspiring the next generation of space travelers.

Thank you to Leena, ShaSha, Caleb, Tejit, Lily, Megan, Chris, and Garrett for making this day of space learning possible.
