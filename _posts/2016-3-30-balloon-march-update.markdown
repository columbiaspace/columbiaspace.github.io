A few updates for the end of March:

- We have received our equipment from CCSC! Thank you to CCSC for supporting us all the way through.
- Our currently planned launch dates are April 9th and the 16th. The launch is an all-day event. There are a limited number of spots on the trip, so please let the team know if you plan on attending the launch and chase.
- We have finalized our launch location to Poughkeepsie, NY. The balloon should land somewhere in Connecticut.
- We are moving forward full steam in preparation for launch. Please stay updated on Slack for the latest updates.

Thanks,
-Jake
