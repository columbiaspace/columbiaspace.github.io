The Force was strong with the Columbia Space Initiative this past December, as 
a crew of 9 space lions joined members of FSAE to see the latest installment of 
the Star Wars saga in stunning IMAX 3D. Arriving in Times Square for our 
showtime at the bizarre hour of 2 in the morning, the Star Wars gang stayed 
sharp with the help of some Jedi mind tricks and caffeine. As we entered the 
theater with the throngs of New Yorkers fitted in Jedi garb, one couldn’t help 
but feel the Force pulsating in the air.

Indeed, The Force Awakens turned out to be one of the most incredible cinematic 
adventures for all of us, replete with moments that make the midichlorians 
tingle down your spine. The rowdy 2am theatergoers gave plenty of thundering 
ovations, and in hindsight the whole experience was more a Knicks game than a 
movie. Though not as scientifically or engineeringly detailed as, say, The 
Martian, The Force Awakens was an awesome reminder of what space stands for in 
the imagination of so many people around the world, and the type of thing that 
got many of us at CSI curious to learn about space in the first place (though 
rocket science isn’t as easy as they make it look like). Anyways, as we enter 
our second semester as a club, stay tuned to our many mission pages as we 
finish… what we started!
