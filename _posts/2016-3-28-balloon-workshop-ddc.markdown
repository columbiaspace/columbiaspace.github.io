Today, we had the pleasure of running a workshop with the [Double Discovery 
Center](https://ddc.college.columbia.edu). Titled, "Exploring the Atmosphere 
with Extreme Balloons", the one hour workshop sought to talk about the 
importance of the ozone layer to life on Earth, the applications of 
high-altitude weather balloons, and combined the two subjects in an interactive 
experiment design discussion.

We really enjoyed doing the workshop, and we would like to thank the DDC for 
hosting us. We hope that we will be able to come back after our launch in 
mid-April and share some science and fun from our project.

Any other organizations that are interested in hosting a similar workshop can 
contact us at our [contact page](http://columbiaspace.org/contact/).

The resources used in the workshop, including the presentation and the 
accompanying notes, are available on the [balloons mission 
page](http://columbiaspace.org/mission-balloons/).
