**Our abstract "Path to Deimos" was selected to continue onto the next stage of the RASC-AL competition!** We are now in full gear working towards our next goal of submitting a mid-project review paper by **March 18, 2016**. The mid-project review will be around 3 pages in length, with 2 pages of text that describes the mission concept and analysis plan, and one page with information graphics and calculations. Based on that, just one more round of cuts will be made before it's decided which teams get to attend the RASC-AL Forum at Cape Canaveral, FL in June.

We'll be recuiting new members to join the RASC-AL team in the coming weeks - stop by one of CSI's general body meetings or reach out to any current member of the mission team if you're interested!
