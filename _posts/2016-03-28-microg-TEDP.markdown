It's 6:55 p.m. (EST) and we have fsubmitted our Technical Equipment Data Package (TEDP) to NASA. It's **40** pages long and written with lots of love from everyone on the team. 

While submitting the TEDP was a great success, we do have some unfortunate news: our asteroid anchor design doesn't quite work. We have tested the design and found that the anchor does not withstand the full 10 lbs of force required. We're working on redesigning the anchor, but with only about 40 days before we head to Houston, we don't have much time for major design changes. It's not a huge issue though - we're relatively certain that our mechanical reasoning is solid; we just need more surface area to interact with the regolith.
