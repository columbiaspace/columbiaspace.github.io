We've finally heard back from NASA on our USIP proposal, and it's unfortunately 
a no go. But that won't stop us. We're exploring a possible collaboration on 
Black Knight II, the U.S. Army's cubesat. We'll keep this page updated as we 
explore more opportunities in the area. Thank you so much to everyone who has 
contributed to our initial proposal, as well as everyone who has supported us 
along the way.
