We submitted our mid-project review to the RASC-AL competition today, after 
making it to the second round. A big thank you to all the project team members 
who dedicated time over their spring breaks to work on our report. We will hear 
back from the competition judges on April 1st as to whether our team's been 
chosen to proceed to the final round of the competition, which entails 
presenting a full 15-page technical paper at the RASC-AL Forum in Cape 
Canaveral this June! Stay tuned!
