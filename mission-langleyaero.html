abstracttext: "Designing a new future of cleaner and quieter aviation"

introtext: "Our undergraduate team is taking on the Langley Aero Design Challenge which calls for a paper detailing the design of a novel large commercial airliner (200+ capacity) that is not only cleaner, but quieter. Utilizing cutting edge technologies including but not limited to Ceramic Matrix Composites, PRANDTL wing, and Distributed Electric Propulsion, we hope to conceive the future of greener flight."
